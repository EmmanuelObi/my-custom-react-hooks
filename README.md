# Welcome to my custom hooks!

I finally got around to open sourcing my most used custom hooks which I take to every project, I really hope you find them useful.
Please STAR the repo and share to your network, also feel free to send in your contributions. I'd love to see how much better we can improve on them.

I also took the liberty of writing tests for each of these hooks, to ensure that they are clean and work as expected.
